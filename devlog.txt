- textparse.js takes input from textbox when the user types. It sends this data to the app.py for backend. It then takes the list of suggestions and overwrites a new list
- elytest.html and the route /elytest/ were created to test this without finishing login and creating accounts

Dhiraj Patel -- 1/12 7:30 - 9:30 PM
- worked on major css stuff with bootstrap for the create 1 html page, and also tried to mess around with some javascript ideas I found for the login/register page; but I ended up saving it for a later day.
- The JavaScript was basically a different way to design our login page; however, I need to show other group members first.

Ely Sandine -- 1/14 18:00 to 23:24
- login.html now uses javascript to rewrite the html form
- added javascript for pages 1-3

Dhiraj patel -- 1/14  21:00 to 23:00
- worked on customizing the bootstrap.min.css file to fit to our CSS standards.
- soldified the color scheme of our website.
- updated the classes for the html form, to conform to the bootstrap code (i.e: btn btn-info) , before I updated it Ely had just labeled them as random classes, so now these changes incorporate bootstrap with them.
- styled each class of the login.html page individually, and just generally made it look nice.
- Remaining: Still have to style the suggestions code that ely wrote (kind of ugly right now), and add <br> tags to the javascript files that ely wrote.

Ely Sandine -- 1/15 9:27 to 2:43
