- textparse.js takes input from textbox when the user types. It sends this data to the app.py for backend. It then takes the list of suggestions and overwrites a new list
- elytest.html and the route /elytest/ were created to test this without finishing login and creating accounts

- worked on major css stuff with bootstrap for the create 1 html page, and also tried to mess around with some javascript ideas I found for the login/register page; but I ended up saving it for a later day.

- The JavaScript was basically a different way to design our login page; however, I need to show other group members first.
